Welcome to the README for Amazon Bestselling Books Analysis with Python! This project is designed to analyze the data from the Amazon Bestselling Books dataset using Python. The dataset contains information on the top 50 bestselling books on Amazon from 2009 to 2019.

To get started, make sure you have Python 3 installed on your machine. You will also need to install the following packages:

pandas
matplotlib
seaborn
Once you have these packages installed, you can begin by downloading the dataset from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/sootersaalu/amazon-top-50-bestselling-books-2009-2019) and saving it to your local machine.

The project contains the following files:

amazon_bestselling_books_analysis.ipynb: This Colab Notebook contains the Python code used to analyze the dataset.
bestsellers with categories.csv: This is the dataset containing the Amazon bestselling books data.
README.md: This file you are currently reading.
To run the Colab Notebook, open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the files, and run the command Colab notebook. This will open a new tab in your web browser where you can navigate to the amazon_bestselling_books_analysis.ipynb file and run the cells in the notebook.

The analysis in the notebook includes exploratory data analysis, data cleaning, and visualizations. The goal of the project is to answer questions such as:

What are the most popular book genres on Amazon?
What are the most popular authors on Amazon?
What is the distribution of ratings for the top 50 bestselling books?
How have book prices changed over time?
The code is commented to provide explanations for each step of the analysis. Feel free to modify the code and explore the data further.
